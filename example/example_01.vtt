00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.733
Hey, and welcome back to Logik
Academy Pro and Flame

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.900
for Nuke Artists.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.333
So as I promised in the last class,
this time we're going

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.833
to finally delve into the image
and bring all those pieces together.

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.466
So everything you learned about
the G mask trace,

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.500
but also about the diamond keyer.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.533
And of course, the mask right from
last class will now be put together.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.666
So without much further ado,
let's dive into batch.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.200
So let's pull out an image node
from the effects nodes.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.433
Bend and connect it
up to our footage.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:32.600
And from the looks of it.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.033
This doesn't look too different
from any other general node

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.266
you can pull from the effects
nodes been.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.366
But as you remember, probably from
the introduction of action way back

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:46.666
when I called this one of the three
human nodes inside of Flame.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.966
So let's dissect this one by one.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.000
If we had a four and open up
the tool.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:55.433
This almost looks like
the master grade from the last class.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:59.566
And this is to be expected
because the mask,

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:04.000
the grade is now applied
not as a node, but as a shader

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.033
inside of this image toolset.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.100
How does this make any sense?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.033
Well, let's pull back a bit.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.100
Image is based on the action toolset.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:18.133
Now action is the 3D compositing
environment of Flame,

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.200
where you can also apply shaders
and the mask,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.000
the grade being, a matchbox shader
being one of them.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.200
So for everything you see from
now on,

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.033
always try to keep in your mind
this is just action

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.800
with a little bit
of different controls to suit this.

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.066
For grading tasks,

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:39.666
the first

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.966
thing I want to draw
your attention to is the HUD up here.

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:47.166
So by default
you always get a primary color

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:51.033
correction,
a first selective to build on.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.100
But there much more
I think you can apply up to 48

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.633
selective color corrections
inside the single node.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.333
And then you've got a general kind

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:04.066
of post-processing output selection
there as well.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:08.333
So these three primary selective
one and output

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.233
are the first ones to work on.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.833
So if we want to give this
a primary grade, we can do that.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.300
So just select the primary

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.600
and do your color correction.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
So this is lock material.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.266
Let's switch our controls to lock

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:30.266
and then we can give this
a very basic

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.200
first grade.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.666
So maybe something like that.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:42.166
So this

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:44.633
is not too different from what we did
in the last class.

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:48.433
And if you familiarize yourself
with the controls there,

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.400
then this shouldn't be too difficult.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.800
However, now
we want to apply selectively.

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:56.733
So to do that,
just click the selective

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.400
one in the hut
and you'll see our interface change.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.266
Now you are in what you call
the Selective Controls panel.

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:08.100
And by the way, this is where
you can see the numbers of selective

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.800
that are available to you
so you can jump through those.

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:15.900
And there are those 48 selectors
I talked about.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:20.533
I got my first selective selected,
but I haven't told Flame

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.733
yet how
I actually want to do the separation.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:28.800
How do I want to make a selective to
then color correct on.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:32.200
We've got a couple of tools
that we can use

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:35.800
to actually achieve
this selection or separation.

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.200
Let's start by something

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.633
really, really simple,
and that would be a G mask.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.133
So with selective one selected right

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:49.000
click in the center
of your image and choose

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.600
at the mask link.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800
And I'm going to go with an ellipse
just to do a basic vignette

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.133
on our very first selection.

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:58.500
So by clicking

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.066
that and pulling that up,
you're drawing up

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.733
exactly the same shape as you would
in the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
G mask tracer if you choose the
G mask ellipse there

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:11.100
and using the same shortcut.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.600
A you can also add
a gradient point like that.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.633
So that is our selectivity find.

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.366
The only thing we should
probably do is inverted

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:23.833
because we probably want to,

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:25.166
bring down the,

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:29.866
the highlights in the outer rim area
instead of the inner circle.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.266
So I'm going to hit invert and then

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:36.033
how do I get to my actual
grading controls?

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.900
Well,
there are two possibilities for that.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.233
The first one is automatically

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.633
Flame will put a master grade

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.966
to each
and every selective that you define.

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:48.166
You can change that.

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.866
You can apply differentiators
as well as mask.

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:53.466
The grade is
just one of many matchbox shaders,

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:56.700
but by default
it'll always apply a mask that great.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.600
And for now this is what
we're going to keep using.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.966
So you just change to that tap.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:05.366
And there
we are back in our familiar controls.

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:09.866
And if I now bring down the lift,

00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:14.133
I can bring down the brightness there

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.266
and thereby apply my vignette.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.766
So if I go to my source image,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:24.366
I see the completely uncorrected
raw footage.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.733
If I had a four, I see the result.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:30.066
And with selective one selected
hitting H

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:34.733
I can just hide this
selective like so.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:38.766
So I see it
with or without my vignette.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.800
The second option you've got

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.400
to switch between your selective
and your actual mask.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.100
The great is to use
the single dropdown

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.866
menu here and change that to double.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.566
So that way
you will have your selective

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:56.966
on the left hand side of the panel

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.300
and a somewhat reduced
version of the mask.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
Look right on the right hand side,
not in functionality.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.000
It's all there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.733
So you've got your curves,
you've got your tones,

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.900
you've got your primaries,
but you're going to go

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.666
without the prime tone combined panel

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:17.233
and you'll have to do much
more switching between menus.

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:19.633
So this is a little bit of a

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:22.266
drawback of this, but it is there

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:24.666
if you want to constantly switch

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:27.500
between refining your selective

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.366
and adjusting your grade,
that might be an option.

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:33.500
There
is actually a third way to switch

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.100
between the selective and the grade
And actually

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.766
every component of your grade,
and that is by using the schematic.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.700
Now, this is something that you're
most likely

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.866
not see in a lot of official

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:52.500
Autodesk documentation
and also training material.

00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:55.800
And that is because the image toolset

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:58.366
is also designed

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.766
to be driven by a controlled surface,

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:04.800
like a tangent wave or element
or something like that.

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:09.000
And a schematic
is something that is pretty inherent

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.466
to be driven by a pen and tablet
and not by a huge control surface.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.966
So I'll try to stick

00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:20.266
to the usage of image
as it is intended,

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:23.800
just to show you a different way
on how to deal with this.

00:07:23.866 --> 00:07:26.100
But, honestly,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.000
I tend to go to the schematic
quite a lot because I use it

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.966
for the G mask tracer.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:35.000
I use it for action
and I am familiar with it.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.266
So if you hit the tilde key,

00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:39.900
you can see our relationship diagram

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.933
build up like we would have done it
in action ourselves.

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:45.333
But this is all built under the hood.

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.466
So this is why I'm
showing this to you. Now.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.433
I want you to see that
even though you're

00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:56.066
using different methods,
this is just action under the hood.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.500
So you've got a surface,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.033
you apply shaders to the surface
and you've got maps

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.600
driving those selections.

00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:07.733
So from now on, you'll constantly

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.200
see me going back to the schematic

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.266
just to illustrate, to show you
what is happening under the hood.

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:18.100
Also,
this is a great failsafe mechanism.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.633
If you get lost
or if you play around with this and

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.500
you accidentally created
something you don't want to

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:26.733
and you don't know how to delete it
or how to disable it,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.933
you can always go back
to your knowledge of action

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.500
and just use those techniques
so you can cut connections

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.266
like you're used to
from your action schematic.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:42.500
You can reconnect, you can hide
elements and so on and so on.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.133
I think you get the idea.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:47.966
Let's continue by adding
another selective and color.

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:49.533
Correct her face a bit more.

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:54.200
So going to the selective controls
menu,

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.466
which is here.

00:08:56.466 --> 00:09:00.866
I can now choose to add a second
selective like that.

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.900
And like before that is fresh.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.200
There's not yet
any method defined on how we want to

00:09:08.266 --> 00:09:10.666
actually separate our image

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:13.700
or parts of our image from the rest.

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:14.633
Okay.

00:09:14.633 --> 00:09:18.433
So for this,
I would like to use the diamond here.

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:23.166
So I'm going to go to the keyers
And one thing I wanted to show you,

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:26.133
because this is something
I constantly do Nuke,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.866
and that is to view
the individual channels.

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:32.266
So to do that,
you're going to use almost exactly

00:09:32.266 --> 00:09:35.000
the same hotkeys as inside of Nuke,
which is.

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:38.800
RG and B for each individual channel
inside a Flame,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.933
you just have to use shift R
for the red channel,

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:45.466
Shift G for the Green channel

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:48.066
and shift B for the blue channel.

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:52.800
So as you might have already expected
from the plane, IGP view,

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:55.133
the Blue channel is our best

00:09:55.133 --> 00:09:57.833
bet to get a proper matte extracted

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.433
or the blue range of the image.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.500
So how do we deal with that?

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.100
Well, making sure my,

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:07.200
selective too is selected.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.266
I'm actually going to activate
the diamond here.

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:13.000
This little guy here
that you already know

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.033
from the color pop like so.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.333
So now I can go about this exactly
the same way as I would

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:21.333
in the color warper.

00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:25.066
I could select a preset like Cyan,

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.566
but I don't see anything.

00:10:27.566 --> 00:10:29.733
how can I actually see my matte?

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:34.066
Well, for that
I have to hit F8 and see

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.166
my selective matte view,

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:43.500
and that can
then be refined from here.

00:10:43.566 --> 00:10:45.133
What I can also do

00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:49.000
if I hit F8 twice
is actually get an overlay

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.233
of that matte onto my image,
which might make things a little bit

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:54.500
easier.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.500
So let's see if we can find that

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.000
a little bit more.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.866
Could also
try to pick our custom color.

00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:06.533
But I think

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.533
the selection
we had actually wasn't too bad.

00:11:09.533 --> 00:11:13.033
If we go back to F14

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:17.633
and then F8 for the overlay,
we catch quite a lot of that.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.266
There are two more things
I want to do.

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:23.100
I want to soften this up a little bit
and then I want to constrain it

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:24.700
by an additional T mask.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.166
So let's start by blurring this,

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:32.700
something like that,
and then I want to apply it.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.233
You must do this as well.

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:36.633
So going back to my result view,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.500
I can either click in the image,
I can also click on my heart

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.833
here, right click and add a mask link

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:47.766
with link, meaning that the t mask

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:51.766
will automatically be linked to that.

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:55.800
And I just picked
so now I'm going to go with free

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.133
instead of Ellipse
and that allows me to draw a G mask

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:07.000
like I would in the G mask tracer
So I'm going to go with this now.

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:10.633
Something like that, kill that,

00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:14.833
point up there, something like that.

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:17.966
So let's get back to F eight
to see if our Matt works

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.700
and we'll see not what we expect.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.300
So if we sat through this,
you see the flat image,

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:26.333
but we don't see

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:28.833
our overlay combined
with our diamond keyer.

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:29.500
Why is that?

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.266
Well, if we head back to the result
view and take a look at the HUD,

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:38.100
you see that
our correct selective is selected.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.700
That is the selective to Diamond,
but also our G mask is selected.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.133
So we just got the view of the G mask
and of itself in the viewer.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.366
If we want to see the result

00:12:49.366 --> 00:12:53.033
of the diamond keyer
and the G mask to combined,

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.166
we need to select
the selective itself

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.800
and then head over to the F8 view.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.966
And there we get what we expect.

00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:04.633
So now we can refine this a bit more.

00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:07.566
Let's bring this over here.

00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:09.800
Let's also add a gradient point

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.300
to further this up,
something like that.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.066
And then of course,
if we shuttled through this clip,

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.700
we see
we need to animate that matter.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.166
We can do that manually
or like with any other G mask

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.500
in action or the G mass tracer,
we can, of course, check that.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.900
So let's try that.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.833
And I'm
actually choosing to track the axis

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:32.200
so I could go to the schematic
and choose it there.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.433
I can also pick the tab up here

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.100
and select rotation and scale

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.866
to have two points
and enter the tracker.

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:43.800
And then I'm just going to do

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.200
a quick track on her eyes

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.266
like, So

00:13:50.266 --> 00:14:06.033
let's see if that sticks.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.133
Something like that

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:11.466
just hit the adjust offset
to bring it back into place.

00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:13.033
And now

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:16.133
yeah, we could probably smoothen

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:20.566
out the scale and rotation
in the channel.

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:23.266
Editor Let's quickly do that.

00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:25.766
So going in over here,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.133
just selecting access
to rotation and scaling,

00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:34.600
holding down shift to select
both the rotation and the scaling,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.833
and then with average selected here,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:43.200
I'm going to smoothen those out.

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:46.800
So as a constrain matte,
that should work for grading.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.133
Okay, great.

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:50.433
So with that

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:53.933
we can finally get back to color
correct this.

00:14:53.933 --> 00:14:56.600
So going to the result View

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.666
Diamond two is selected.

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:01.000
I'm going to go to Master grade two.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.866
It's really helpful that image names
these all accordingly.

00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:10.566
So G Mask two, access
to master grade to

00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:13.000
are all tied to selective two.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.400
So of course
at one point that might break,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.966
but as much as possible
image will try to keep those numbers

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:22.800
sensible so

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.200
to indicate which belongs to which.

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:29.966
And once again, if you falter,
if you're not sure which axis which

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.900
you mask you are actually working

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.700
on, always go back to the schematic.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.566
I think this is something
that as a new artist

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.166
you'll probably understand.

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.800
And the easiest.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.200
All right, master grade to select it.

00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:48.233
And now we can adjust this skin tone.

00:15:48.233 --> 00:15:52.066
So maybe you will try to bring it
a little bit

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:56.800
more in on the lively side,
something like that.

00:15:56.866 --> 00:15:58.600
Lets hide that for a minute.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.266
Yeah, I think this isn't too bad.

00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:07.033
So the
last thing I want to show you in

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:11.500
this class is how to properly label
your individual selector.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.600
So that's pretty easy.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.833
Just by right clicking in here,
we can rename this

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:20.166
vignette

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.366
like so.

00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:24.633
So now this is properly labeled

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:27.033
and if we go to the second one,

00:16:27.033 --> 00:16:30.066
you could also use
the object window down here.

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:33.900
So if you don't want to call this
diamond, which just refers to the key

00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:36.600
instead of the actual object
in the image,

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:40.366
you could call this face

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.066
like so.

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:44.566
Okay, so I'm going to close this

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:48.133
class out now, and in the next class
we're going to continue

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:51.400
our exploration
of the image tool, said.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.766
And then we'll also take a look
at some other means

00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:56.233
on how to separate your image.

00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:59.466
So we'll take a look at the machine
learning inside of Flame

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:03.800
and also 3D areas,
which could be pretty exciting.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.833
So thank you so much for watching.

00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:07.433
Until next time. Bye bye.
