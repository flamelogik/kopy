I need help creating a python script that does the following:

1.  Asks for a name of the Video Transcript, to assist in the summaries below and to include in the output filenames.
2.  Asks for the Instructor Name, so that the summaries below can refer to her/him by name.
3.  Asks for video transcript, which will be provided as a VTT file.
4.  Once the video transcript has been entered, I want it to perform a search and replace function for "broken words", which are words that Adobe auto subtitling get wrong all the time with out complex technical language.  See the confgurations.txt for a format and examples.  It looks like this...

word_to_find_1: replacement_word_1
word_to_find_2: replacement_word_2

5.  I then want the script to save the result file as <name of the video transcript>(eng).vtt

6.  I then want the script to ask Chat GPT to output a txt file called <name of the video transcript>_kopy.txt, with the following three actions performed:

A.  Provide a 5-7 sentence summary of the video transcript.
B.  Provide a 140 character short summary of the video transcript.
C.  Provide a 170 character summary optimized for keywords and SEO.

7.  I then want Chat GPT to include in that text file an email with the following format:

Subject:  ðŸ”¥<name of the video transcript> is out!ðŸ”¥
Body:

Yo {{username}}!  
{{content.title}} just dropped on {{store.title}}. Â <Insert the 5-7 sentence summary from above>. 

Sign it: 
Enjoy!

The Yo "{{username}}!  
{{content.title}} just dropped on {{store.title}}" is from the Uscreen website and I want you to include that raw data as is.
 

IMPORTANT!
{{username}}
{{content.title}}
{{store.title}}

These are variables that are present in the Uscreen platform.  Meaning, I want the resulting email to use these and keep these unchanged so that Uscreen can insert its own data.
